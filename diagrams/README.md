# Technical Diagrams

This directory contains technical diagrams for the Pais Effect Demonstrator.

## Mermaid Diagrams

Most diagrams are embedded directly in the documentation as Mermaid code blocks, which GitHub renders automatically.

## SVG Diagrams

For more detailed technical drawings, use SVG format:
- Created with Inkscape, Figma, or similar tools
- Scalable for documentation and printing
- Can be edited by contributors

## Diagram Conventions

- Use consistent colors matching the documentation
- Include dimensions in metric units (mm)
- Label all components clearly
- Include a title block with version/date

- [ ] `mechanical-assembly-exploded.svg` - Exploded view of vibration stack
- [ ] `electrical-schematic-full.svg` - Complete electrical schematic
- [ ] `sensor-placement.svg` - Sensor array positioning
- [ ] `faraday-cage-construction.svg` - Cage assembly details
