# Pais Effect Patents - Summary and Analysis

> Summary of the key US Navy patents filed by Salvatore Cezar Pais that form the theoretical basis for this demonstrator project.

---

## Overview

Between 2016 and 2019, Salvatore Cezar Pais, working for the US Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), filed several patents describing unconventional propulsion and energy generation concepts. These patents are notable for their extraordinary claims and the unusual level of Navy support during prosecution.

**Important Note:** These patents describe theoretical concepts that are not accepted by mainstream physics. This project aims to experimentally test one specific claim - that vibrating, electrically charged matter produces anomalous effects - using rigorous methodology.

## Relevant Patents

### US10,144,532 B2 - Craft Using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device

**Filed:** April 28, 2016
**Granted:** December 4, 2018
**Assignee:** United States of America as represented by Secretary of the Navy

#### Key Claims

The patent describes a craft using:

> "...an inertial mass reduction device comprising an inner resonant cavity wall, an ## outer resonant cavity wall, and microwave emitters... The inertial mass reduction device generates a local polarized vacuum outside the outer resonant cavity wall."

#### Relevant Excerpts for This Project

From the specification (emphasis added):

> "It is possible to **reduce the inertial mass and hence the gravitational mass** of a system/object in motion, by an abrupt perturbation of the non-linear background of local spacetime."

> "The physical mechanism which drives this diminishing of inertial mass is based on the **coupling of high frequency axial spin** (induced electromagnetic fields... vibration/rotation of electrically charged matter)..."

> "If we can **engineer the structure of the local quantum vacuum state**, we can engineer physical reality..."

#### Experimental Approach Derived

This patent suggests that:
1. High-frequency vibration of electrically charged matter may produce effects
2. The mechanism involves local spacetime/vacuum engineering
3. Observable effects might include mass reduction

Our demonstrator focuses on the simplest testable claim: vibrating charged matter.

### US10,322,827 B2 - High Frequency Gravitational Wave Generator

**Filed:** May 1, 2017
**Granted:** June 18, 2019
**Assignee:** United States of America as represented by Secretary of the Navy

#### Key Claims

> "A high frequency gravitational wave generator including a gas-filled shell with an outer surface, electromagnetic field generators, and acoustic vibration generators..."

#### Relevant Excerpts

> "...if we **vibrate electrically charged matter at high frequencies while subjecting it to rapid spin and/or acceleration**, we would expect the emission of high frequency gravitational waves."

> "The amplitude of the resultant gravitational waves is directly related to the **magnitude of the electric charge**, the **frequency of vibration**, and the **rate of acceleration**."

#### Quantitative Predictions

The patent provides equations for the expected effect magnitude:

```
h ~ (G/c⁴) × (charge density) × (frequency)² × (characteristic length)²
```

Where:
- G = gravitational constant
- c = speed of light
- h = gravitational wave strain

**Calculated values suggest extremely small effects** unless charge densities and frequencies far exceed conventional technology.

### US10,135,366 B2 - Electromagnetic Field Generator and Method

**Filed:** May 1, 2017
**Granted:** November 20, 2018
**Assignee:** United States of America as represented by Secretary of the Navy

#### Key Claims

Describes generating high electromagnetic field intensities via rapid rotation of electrified matter:

> "...rotate electrically charged systems at high angular velocities... inducing the generation of very high electromagnetic field strengths and flux values."

#### Relevance to This Project

While our demonstrator uses vibration rather than rotation, the underlying concept - that accelerating charged matter produces anomalous effects - is tested.

## Critical Analysis

### Theoretical Concerns

1. **Violation of Established Physics**
   - No mechanism in known physics connects vibrating charges to gravitational effects
   - Predicted effects would require modification of general relativity

2. **Order of Magnitude Problems**
   - Calculated gravitational wave amplitudes are ~10⁻⁴⁰ or smaller
   - Far below any conceivable detection threshold

3. **Conservation Laws**
   - Mass reduction would violate conservation of energy
   - No proposed mechanism for where energy goes

### Prosecution History Anomalies

The patent examiner initially rejected these patents as being inoperable (too far from established physics). The Navy submitted declarations asserting the concepts were workable, which is unusual.

From Navy declaration (public record):
> "Dr. Pais is a competent scientist... the invention described in the patent application is operable..."

### What This Project Tests

Despite theoretical concerns, the scientific approach demands experimental testing. This project specifically tests whether:

1. A vibrating, charged copper plate produces any measurable anomalous magnetic field
2. Such fields (if present) have characteristics consistent with Pais's predictions
3. Effects can be distinguished from known electromagnetic phenomena

## Experimental Parameters from Patents

### Suggested Operating Conditions

Based on patent specifications:

| Parameter | Patent Suggestion | Our Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Charge density | "High" (unspecified) | ~10-50 kV surface potential |
| Vibration frequency | "High frequency" (kHz-MHz) | 1-10 kHz (practical limit) |
| Material | Conductor | Copper plate |
| Geometry | Various (disc, cone, etc.) | Flat disc |
| Detection | Not specified | Magnetometer array |

### Expected Signal (If Effect Exists)

The patents do not provide quantitative predictions for magnetic field generation. Our null hypothesis is:

> H₀: No magnetic field anomaly beyond known electromagnetic effects will be detected.

Any detected anomaly would need to:
- Correlate with vibration frequency
- Scale with charge
- Not be explainable by conventional EM coupling

## Disclaimer

This summary is provided for experimental context only. The claims in these patents are not accepted by mainstream physics. This project takes no position on validity - it simply attempts rigorous experimental testing of a specific, testable sub-claim.

A null result (no anomalous effect detected) is a valid and important scientific outcome.
